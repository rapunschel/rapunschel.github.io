title: About 
---

Hello, I'm Cornelia, originally from Scania[^1]. I moved to Gothenburg in 2018 to study at Gothenburg University and have been living here ever since. Came here to study mathematics but ended up studying computer science in 2020 and graduated with a bachelor's in 2024. 

After a failed attempt at doing a master's in Computer Science - mostly because I was tired of studying. I decided to finally be free to pursue my interests, learning web dev and doing personal projects.

When I'm not coding, you'll likely find me enjoying board games, biking, or watching anime. On rare occasions I play chess, something I used to do a lot when I was younger but that I unfortunately haven't done as much.

Curious about what I've done? Check out [my projects](projects.md).

Interested in my [CV](https://github.com/rapunschel/cv/raw/main/cv.pdf)?
